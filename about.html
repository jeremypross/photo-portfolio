            Born and raised in Brooklyn, Joel Brodsky graduated from Syracuse University in 1961 where he took his first and only course in photography. After graduation he worked at a local camera store acquiring the cameras he used when he went into business. Following a brief stint in the Army he worked as an assistant for one of New York’s top fashion photographers where he learned about commercial photography.

            In 1967, he opened his own studio where he shot his first photos that were used on an album. Joel's fourth cover shooting for The Doors was part of a package that got nominated for a Grammy, (the first of nine covers he did for The Doors), which gave him access to many other record labels.

            In a time when the cover art was the only visual representation of their artists for the record buying public, Brodsky’s style helped to create an image for artists such as Aretha Franklin, Judy Collins, Van Morrison, Iggy Pop, Isaac Hayes, John Lee Hooker, Country Joe &amp; the Fish, and Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips. Among the last of his album photo sessions was the first Kiss cover in 1975. Later in his career, Brodsky worked for many commercial clients including Revlon, Avon, Dupont, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales.
